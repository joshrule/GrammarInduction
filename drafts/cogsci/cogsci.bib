	annote = {- Understanding the relationship between position in the number list and numerosity is itself crucial to say that a child understands the process of kinding.
- The problem isn't primarily learning number concepts, but figuring out how to map those concepts to words, a reference task.
- What children must learn in these cases is properties of sets of items, but when we count, a number is assigned to each item.
- Carey has shown that contrasting unknown words with known words in a field leads to novel induction.
- If syntax helps, it's by lumping over several syntactic rules, not just one, because some are indistinguishable from adjectives or nouns.
- Gelman's theory relies on three core principles:
    - 1-1 correspondence
    - stable ordering of number tags
    - cardinality: last tag represent cardinality of set
- But, children learn to count and learn some number words before understanding cardinality
- Fuson's theory is that children learn the song, learn the count routine, and learn cardinality all separately, and only coincidentally begin to connect them into an integrated concept
- Wynn (1990) shows that kids understand that number isn't referring to individuals, though, even at 2:6.
- In give-a-number tasks, kids often label the last item correctly when counting out items, even if they choose the wrong number.
- subset knowers don't use counting to give their subsets
- What tasks should the system do?
    - give-a-number
    - how-many
    - point-to-a-cardinal-set
- Children don't treat unknown number words as nonsense words
- Children definitely know \"1\" by about 2:6, which then allows them to figure out \"1\" vs \"3\" or \"1\" vs \"4\" even if they don't know \"3\" or \"4\". Knowing the meaning of \"1\" and that {\"1\",\"2\",\"3\",\"4\"} are mutually exclusive makes it possible to answer this question.
- The last-word rule for counting a set and knowing the Cardinal Principle seem to be different pieces of knowledge.
- Wynn favors the hypothesis that children learn that number words deal with quantity by syntax, based on 3 premises:
    - determiners have a common syntax and are linked to quantification
    - children can pick up on this syntax by 2:6.
    - children understand the semantics of determiners by 2:6.
- Contrastive presentations of number (no, you can't have 3, only 2!) may be crucial to demonstrating that numbers refer to specific cardinalities

My thoughts:
- Is counting the key phenomenon, or the understanding of natural number? We can know how natural number works without understanding the count list, though such a case might be slightly pathological.
- So, a difficulty we haven't even considered is that you have to figure out that number words refer to sets rather than objects, even though you typically just point out objects.
- So, kids learn that:
    - words are related in some way
    - words are related by numerosity
    - words are related by cardinality of sets represented by position in the number list
- Wynn is wrong in supposing kids understand that number words are numerical early on. They may understand \"1\" and that number words form a field, but that doesn't mean they understand that \"2\" is also discusses numerosity.
- Before learning the CP, children don't understand how counting could be useful in determining a set, so they don't use it. They meshes nicely with the fact that counting comes after learning that the field is numerical, and thus that approximate magnitude can be used.
- Another reason \"2\" could be difficult is that you're distinguishing a particular set size for the first time. You may have the concept of a set, but simply lump all sets greater than size 1 into the \"large set\" category.}
